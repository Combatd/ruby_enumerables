# ruby_enumerables
ruby enumerables debugging project

It is time to use the pry REPL and terminal to debug code in Ruby.

Getting comfortable with these tools early will be very important in becoming an efficient developer. After learning them, these tools will make just about any operation you can think of faster than using a GUI and mouse.

We're going to implement some Array methods. There are descriptions for each method, but it may help to also consult the official Ruby docs for Enumerable and Array. These are good resources in general, and useful reading during this first week.

Note: Unlike in the prepwork, there are no specs to compare against. You'll have to test your code in pry.

## Learning Goals
* Be able to create directories and files from the command line
* Know how to extend classes
* Know how to use pry to test methods
* Be able to write methods that take a block as an argument
* Get comfortable reasoning about how enumerable methods work with arrays

### Iterable Functions
* #factors(num)
* #bubble_sort!(&prc)
* #bubble_sort(&prc)
* #substrings(string)
* #subwords(word, dictionary)

### Enumerables
* Array#my_each
* Array#my_select
* Array#my_reject
* Array#my_any

### Array Monkey Patching
* #my_flatten
* #my_zip
* #my_rotate
* #my_join
* #my_reverse
