ruby enumerables debugging project

From this point on, we will be using the command line and pry to test our code, navigate our computer, and perform many other amazing tasks.

This means that we are not using repl.it anymore to test our code.

Getting comfortable with these tools early will be very important in becoming an efficient developer. After learning them, these tools will make just about any operation you can think of faster than using a GUI and mouse.

We're going to implement some Array methods. There are descriptions for each method, but it may help to also consult the official Ruby docs for Enumerable and Array. These are good resources in general, and useful reading during this first week.

Note: Unlike in the prepwork, there are no specs to compare against. You'll have to test your code in pry.

- Be able to create directories and files from the command line
- Know how to extend classes
- Know how to use pry to test methods
- Be able to write methods that take a block as an argument
- Get comfortable reasoning about how enumerable methods work with arrays
